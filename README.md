Ted was born in Shaker Heights, Ohio (in real life, Josh Radnor grew up in the Columbus, Ohio area and writer Carter Bays is from Shaker Heights). He was seen cheering for the Cleveland Indians when they were playing the Yankees at a baseball game in the episode Where Were We? and also alluded to once being trapped under a fake rock at a mall in Ohio when he was 9 in the episode Slap Bet. He also wears a Cleveland Indians t-shirt in Sandcastles in the Sand. Though Ted lost his virginity in 1995 to Molly, it is revealed in Sorry, Bro that during his high school years and periodically during college, Ted dated his long-term girlfriend Karen. He and Marshall were randomly assigned as freshman year roommates at Wesleyan but became friends on a long road trip that was deemed both "Fieroasco" (by Marshall) and the "100k Fiasco" (by Ted). This story was told in Arrivederci, Fiero. Ted graduated from Wesleyan with Marshall in 2000 as implied in the episode How I Met Everyone Else.
